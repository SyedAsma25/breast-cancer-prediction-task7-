### üéØ Project Objective

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to accurately diagnose breast cancer as either **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)** based on diagnostic measurements. We leverage Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels and tune hyperparameters to maximize predictive performance.

### üìñ Dataset Information

The analysis is performed on the **Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset**. It contains 569 instances with 30 numeric features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Workflow

1.  **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and features are scaled using `StandardScaler`. The target variable `diagnosis` is label-encoded.
2.  **Kernel Comparison**: We train two initial SVM models‚Äîone with a `linear` kernel and one with a `rbf` (Radial Basis Function) kernel‚Äîto compare their baseline performance.
3.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation is employed to systematically search for the optimal `C` (regularization) and `gamma` hyperparameters for the RBF kernel.
4.  **Model Evaluation**: The best-performing model from the grid search is evaluated on an independent test set. Performance is measured by accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.
5.  **Visualization**: Decision boundaries for the linear and RBF kernels are plotted on a 2D subset of the data for intuitive comparison.

### üìä Results & Performance

The hyperparameter-tuned SVM with an RBF kernel demonstrated superior performance, achieving excellent accuracy in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors.

#### Key Findings:
- **Optimal Hyperparameters**: `C=10`, `gamma=0.01` (example values).
- **Cross-Validation Score**: ~98% accuracy during grid search.
- **Final Test Accuracy**: ~98.6% on the held-out test set.
